For more information about the department, please visit our website: http://dhsh.sfgov.org/
What We Do
San Francisco is a pioneer in homeless services and a leader in providing supportive housing as a permanent exit from homelessness.

Color Of Change is the nation’s largest online racial justice organization. We develop strategies to put an end to policies and practices holding Black people back, while championing the solutions that move all people forward. As a national force driven by over one million members, we move decision-makers in corporations and government to create a more humane and less hostile world for Black people in America. In 2005, Color Of Change was founded in response to the realization that during the Hurricane Katrina crisis, no one was afraid to disappoint Black people. There were no consequences for Black people being left stranded on their roofs to die, nor was there sufficient infrastructure among Black communities to aggregate our power and demand them for those that perpetuated or refused to acknowledge the tragic injustice. Color Of Change is impacting lives by introducing accountability into the systems of decision-making. We leverage emerging technologies and our media savvy and sharp focus to build the power it takes to move decision makers in corporations, media and government to drive meaningful change for Black people in service of ending injustice for all oppressed groups.

Color Of Change is the nation’s largest online racial justice organization. We develop strategies to put an end to policies and practices holding Black people back, while championing the solutions that move all people forward. As a national force driven by over one million members, we move decision-makers in corporations and government to create a more humane and less hostile world for Black people in America. In 2005, Color Of Change was founded in response to the realization that during the Hurricane Katrina crisis, no one was afraid to disappoint Black people. There were no consequences for Black people being left stranded on their roofs to die, nor was there sufficient infrastructure among Black communities to aggregate our power and demand them for those that perpetuated or refused to acknowledge the tragic injustice. Color Of Change is impacting lives by introducing accountability into the systems of decision-making. We leverage emerging technologies and our media savvy and sharp focus to build the power it takes to move decision makers in corporations, media and government to drive meaningful change for Black people in service of ending injustice for all oppressed groups.

The team – Health Care

Focuses on assisting those organizations that are responsible for the delivery, funding and payment management of health care and medical related services. Clients include hospitals, academic medical centers, health systems, home health agencies, long term care, outpatient facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, practitioners and physician groups as well as health plans, other health insurance companies, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).


Supply Chain & Manufacturing Operations: Our Supply Management & Digital Procurement Talent Group improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the planning/engineering, sourcing, manufacturing, and delivery/logistics of business processes to create a strategic, competitive advantage.
One of the services our practice provides to health care providers is supply chain optimization (pricing and utilization), including analyzing the group purchasing organization, contracts and inventories to find ways to reduce costs and make smart buying decisions.


Work you’ll do

Managers are professionals with strong records of academic and professional achievement who have the capacity and desire for continuous development and growth. Deloitte professionals must also be capable of working and communicating with people at all levels of an organization.

Managers lead multiple project work streams, small engagement teams or components of large, complex engagements. They mentor junior practitioners as they conduct detailed, quantitative analyses associated with developing meaningful insights to address health care providers’ biggest challenges. These challenges encompass everything from helping providers increase revenues, decrease costs, accelerate cash flow, improve margin and operational workflows by addressing people, processes, and technology across every aspect of the project lifecycle.
Deloitte managers typically work with a project team dedicated to a single client, taking direction from the project manager or Principal/Partner/Director. They work side by side with Principals/Partner/Directors, often with exposure to C-level executives and organizational leaders. Project teams work onsite with the client team, typically necessitating travel three to four nights a week.

As a manager, you will be asked to provide leadership in a variety of challenging roles, make significant contributions in a relatively short time, take responsibility for the way you manage your time, develop your skill set, and deliver creative, compelling insights to the client. Your career success is dependent on your ability to personalize your career path and identify and grow your internal and external network. We don’t expect you to do this alone - our environment provides multiple opportunities for you to further develop your skills through our training curriculum and mentoring programs.

about you

You are inquisitive. Nothing makes you grind your teeth more than hearing the phrase “because we’ve always done it that way.” Instead of accepting that things “are the way they are,” you ask questions; you challenge the process; you look to other disciplines; in short, you are constantly striving to understand and make things better.

You are adaptable. When you hear the word “problem,” you think “opportunity.” You understand that change is not optional, but inevitable…and in understanding that, you prefer to be the one driving the (positive) change.

You are dedicated. When you commit to something, you’re in it to win it. You view obstacles as challenges…and you’re always up for a challenge.

You understand the power of numbers. It’s possible you’ve been described as a geek, or a savant. Either way, your quantitative, Excel, and analysis skills are off the charts. And the most amazing part about it is that your “geek like” qualities haven’t impacted your strong interpersonal and communication skills. Truly, you have it all.

You’re a juggler. You easily manage multiple priorities, making it look easy.

You are true to yourself. You have a deep sense of self-awareness, and don’t play games with people. You are confident, yet humble. You are who you are….and you feel pretty good about that.

You’re an “A-Player”. You have a demonstrated track record of success. People who you’ve worked for are glad they hired you…and sorry to see you go. People that work with you are energized, happy, and successful.

If this job sounds like it is one that will make you shine, please send us your resume and tell us why you would be the best addition to our team.",700da030fe432d61,Service Coordinator,en,"indeed_clk(this,'7149');","Intermediate vocational education (College <b>level</b>).

Global Equity: Global Employer Services assists clients with all aspects involved in offering equity-based compensation to their employees to enable employee ownership while efficiently maintaining global regulatory and tax compliance. Working with stakeholder groups, GES provides end-to-end support including design, optimization, compliance, payroll, corporate transactions, communication strategies, and process improvement initiatives.

Transactions: Transactions take many forms such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.

Your career success is dependent on your ability to personalize your career path and identify and grow your internal and external network.

This important work leads to acquisitions and investments by our blue chip list of private equity funds, hedge funds, corporations, and Fortune 500 CEOs.
The Junior Analyst position is a temp-to-hire one where the individual works 40 hours/week in a temporary capacity for a maximum of six months. During this time,periodic informal performance reviews are conducted, and the individual and the company are able to assess whether there is a mutual fit. After completing 4-6 months in the position, and an Analyst position is available, the candidate will be considered for a full-time Analyst role. Analysts are salaried employees with full benefits (medical insurance, 401-k plan, etc.).
